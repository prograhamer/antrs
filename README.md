# antrs

Rust implementation of an interface with ANT+ USB devices.

This is a learning project so not necessarily the best quality code. It may improve as I become more familiar with rust.

See `examples/` for simple example usage.

Requires access to the ANT+ network key in order to communicate with any off-the-shelf devices.
This cannot be published in a public repo, but can be easily obtained for free
from thisisant.com by registering as an adopter. This also gives access to other technical documents describing the
messaging, etc.
